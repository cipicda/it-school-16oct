        Located some 275 km (171 mi) north-west of Bucharest,[6] the town
        straddles the Cibin River, a tributary of the Olt River. Now the county
        seat (Romanian: oraș reședință de județ) of the Sibiu County, between
        1692 and 1791 and 1849–65 Sibiu was the capital of the Principality of
        Transylvania (Romanian: Principatul Transilvaniei, German:
        Großfürstentum Siebenbürgen). During the Modern era, the Hecht hause in
        Sibiu served as the seat of the Transylvanian Saxon University
