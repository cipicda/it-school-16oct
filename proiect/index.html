          Both AMD and NVIDIA offer graphics cards with varying performance
          levels to cater to different user needs. Performance can depend on the
          specific models, and it's essential to compare benchmarks for the
          tasks or applications that matter most to you, whether it's gaming,
          content creation, or other professional workloads.
        </p>
        <p class="color2">
          Both companies have introduced unique technologies and features.
          NVIDIA has features like real-time ray tracing, DLSS (Deep Learning
          Super Sampling), and technologies like G-Sync for gaming monitors. AMD
          has its own set of technologies, such as FidelityFX for image
          upscaling, and FreeSync for adaptive sync with monitors.
